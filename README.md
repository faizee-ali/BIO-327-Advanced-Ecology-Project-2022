# Spiders-Community-Analyses
This repository contains the R version 4.1.2 code script used to analyse the data collected for a spider community assemblage project that I did as a part of a course.

Here I assess the effect of vegetation structure on spider communities in the IISER Tirupati Permanent Campus with the help of different habitat zones(natural scrubland, anthropogenically disturbed scrubland, and artificial lawn). I test the hypothesis that spider community complexity increases with plant diversity, plant cover, and plant density. Also, evaluate the difference in composition of spider communities between the distinct habitats.
